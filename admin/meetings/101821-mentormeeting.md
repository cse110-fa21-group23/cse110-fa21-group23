  - Who are we making the product for?

  - Do we want to make this for a specific set of people or are we creating for the general people?
- Questions to ask ourselves about the product
  - Who is it for?
  - What are they using it for
  - When will they use it?
    - Cook immediately and eat immediately?
    - Store it and use it later?

  - How easy is it?
  - How much time will it take to make?
  - Cost?
  - What ingredients does it use?
  - What dietary restrictions does it have?
  - What is our target?
- Start thinking about where we will be getting our recipes from
  - There are recipes on the net, where will be requiring from
  - Or will we be creating the recipes ourselves
- API for recipes
  - <https://developer.edamam.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwtrSLBhCLARIsACh6Rmiel2G4TitNj3iRH820rH-L2_y3UQc8MMu0FfY20auQV5QmnuToP3MaArXSEALw_wcB>
- It will be a CRUD app
  - Create, read, update, delete
- Is it fine to take recipes from the internet
  - Yes, it is fine, we don’t need to create recipes from scratch
  - Are we going to pre-load the site with recipes or will we be having a search bars for users to search in other places
- Brainstorm ideas
  - For next meeting, we will be talking about our ideas
- Why do users need to use our application? Instead of just Googling it?
  - Ease of access, google gives too much info
    - Too much information is overwhelming
  - A website can have tags so the user can search for specific recipes
    - Advanced filtering
    - Will we pre-define tags or will users create these tags?
- Editing recipes and create a profile
- Favorite recipes and save them for later
- Deletion: we can remove some recipes from our search
- Miro
