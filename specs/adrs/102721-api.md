* Deciders: Kevin, Amitesh, David, Felix, Karina, Them, Christopher, Flynn, Nhi, Suditi
* Date: 10-20-2021 

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to detemrine which API to use for our web application. There are plenty of APIs that return recipes, but we need to find one that fits our specific needs such as ingredient list, dietary tags, instructions, etc. 

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Ease of use
* The API which provides all the details we need
* Best documented API

## Considered Options

* Spoonacular API
* Edamam API
* Kaggle API

## Decision Outcome

We decided to go with Spoonacular API. This is because the other APIs did not include instruction steps, which is an integral feature of our web application.

### Pros of Spoonacular <!-- optional -->

* Able to get instructions
* Able to get dietary tags and intolerances for each recipe
* Provides ingredients list
* Easy to set up and call
* Proper documentation on the website

### Cons of Spoonacular <!-- optional -->
* Can't apply multiple dietary tags
