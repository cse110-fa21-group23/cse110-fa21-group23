# Tag Functionality

* Status: Proposed
* Deciders: Karina and David
* Date: 2021-11-28

## Where to put the apply filter button?
- we decided it should only appear to the right of the filter categories only after the user selects tags

## Decision Drivers
- Not necessary to have it before any filters are selected
- It may clutter the site with unnecessary buttons that may annoy the user

## Considered Options
- Having the apply filter button show all the time even when users are not interacting with filters
- Having the apply filter button on the bottom of all the filters
 

## Question: which filters do we want to allow multiple selection functionality?
- we were thinking that only the cuisine and meal type should be allowed for the user to select multiple tags
- We changed our minds and allowed for all filters for multiple selection functionality as this also allows the user to deselect filters as we are using a checkbox instead of radio.

## Decision Drivers
- how complex and difficult will it be to implement multiple selection for each filter category?
- would it make sense to apply multiple different tags in the particular category?

## Considered options
- having all categories with multiple selection functionality
- only having the cuisine and meal type have multiple selection functionality

## Question: have the filters show up before or after the search query entered?
- at first we were thinking about having the filters show up before any search query is entered as this would allow users who don't know what they want to cook to use the filters to search
- However we decided to make things simpler by having the filters after the search query to make the implementation easier and less complex for users

## Decision Drivers
- complexity of the search and filter process
- Ease of implementing desired option
- What if the user wants to use the filters to search for recipes

## Considered options
- filters appearing before any search queries
- filters appearing after a search query is inputted
