# Tag Functionality

* Status: Proposed
* Deciders: Karina and David
* Date: 2021-11-28

## Where to put the apply filter button?
- we decided it should only appear to the right of the filter categories only after the user selects tags

## Decision Drivers
- Not necessary to have it before any filters are selected
- It may clutter the site with unnecessary buttons that may annoy the user

## Considered Options
- Having the apply filter button show all the time even when users are not interacting with filters
- Having the apply filter button on the bottom of all the filters
 

## Question: which filters do we want to allow multiple selection functionality?
- we were thinking that only the cuisine and meal type should be allowed for the user to select multiple tags

## Decision Drivers
- how complex and difficult will it be to implement multiple selection for each filter category?
- would it make sense to apply multiple different tags in the particular category?

## Considered options
- having all categories with multiple selection functionality
- only having the cuisine and meal type have multiple selection functionality

## Question: have the filters show up before after the search?
- we were thinking the filters should show up before the search just in case users don't know what they want and just want to filter different recipes first

## Decision Drivers
- More ways for the user to search for recipes
- They are helpful incase the user doesn't know what they want
- What if the user wants to use the filters to search for recipes

## Considered options
- filters appearing before any search queries
- filters appearing after a search query is inputted
