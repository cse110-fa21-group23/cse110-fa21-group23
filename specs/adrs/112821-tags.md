# Tag Functionality

* Status: Proposed
* Deciders: Karina and David
* Date: 2021-11-28

## Where to put the apply filter button?
- we decided it should only appear to the right of the filter categories only after the user selects tags

## Decision Drivers
- Not necessary to have it before any filters are selected
- It may clutter the site with unnecessary buttons that may annoy the user

## Considered Options
- Having the apply filter button show all the time even when users are not interacting with filters
- Having the apply filter button on the bottom of all the filters
 

## Question: which filters do we want to allow multiple selection functionality?
- we were thinking that only the cuisine and meal type should be allowed for the user to select multiple tags
- Thus the diet and time should stay radio as it doesn't make sense to look for recipes of different diets or conflicting times
- However, even though the diet and time categories are still radio buttons that doesn't mean the user can't select the filter again to remove it. We implemented it so that the user can deselect a time or diet filter but only select one filter in each of these categories

## Decision Drivers
- how complex and difficult will it be to implement multiple selection for each filter category?
- would it make sense to apply multiple different tags in the particular category?

## Considered options
- having all categories with multiple selection functionality
- only having the cuisine and meal type have multiple selection functionality


## Question: have the filters show up before or after the search query entered?
- at first we were thinking about having the filters show up before any search query is entered as this would allow users who don't know what they want to cook to use the filters to search
- However we decided to make things simpler by having the filters after the search query to make the implementation easier and less complex for users

## Decision Drivers
- complexity of the search and filter process
- Ease of implementing desired option
- What if the user wants to use the filters to search for recipes

## Considered options
- filters appearing before any search queries
- filters appearing after a search query is inputted


## Question: how should the interaction between the dietary restrictions and diet filter work?
- At first we didn't know how to resolve this. At point we thought to just get rid of the diet filter.
- But now we decided for a pop up message to appear alerting the user that using the diet filter will override their dietary restrictions in the settings

## Decision Drivers
- The usefulness/convenience of still having a diet filter vs just totally removing it 
- The conflict between the dietary restrictions in settings and the diet filter and which should take precedence
- The difficulty to implement

## considered options
- totally removing the diet filter so the user needs to use the settings page to set dietary restrictions
- having the diet filter but if the user usess it then it overrides the dietary restrictions in the settings
